    "In preceding notebooks, performed preliminary assessments of data quality and refined the question to be answered. You found a small number of data values that gave clear choices about whether to replace values or drop a whole row. You determined that predicting the adult weekend ticket price was your primary aim. You threw away records with missing price data, but not before making the most of the other available data to look for any patterns between the states. You didn't see any and decided to treat all states equally; the state label didn't seem to be particularly useful.\n",

    "In this notebook you'll start to build machine learning models. Before even starting with learning a machine learning model, however, start by considering how useful the mean value is as a predictor. This is more than just a pedagogical device. You never want to go to stakeholders with a machine learning model only to have the CEO point out that it performs worse than just guessing the average! Your first model is a baseline performance comparitor for any subsequent model. You then build up the process of efficiently and robustly creating and assessing models against it. The development we lay out may be little slower than in the real world, but this step of the capstone is definitely more than just instructional. It is good practice to build up an understanding that the machine learning pipelines you build work as expected. You can validate steps with your own functions for checking expected equivalence between, say, pandas and sklearn implementations."

    "So far, you've treated ski resort data as a single entity. In machine learning, when you train your model on all of your data, you end up with no data set aside to evaluate model performance. You could keep making more and more complex models that fit the data better and better and not realise you were overfitting to that one set of samples. By partitioning the data into training and testing splits, without letting a model (or missing-value imputation) learn anything about the test split, you have a somewhat independent assessment of how your model might perform in the future. An often overlooked subtlety here is that people all too frequently use the test set to assess model performance _and then compare multiple models to pick the best_. This means their overall model selection process is  fitting to one specific data set, now the test split. You could keep going, trying to get better and better performance on that one data set, but that's  where cross-validation becomes especially useful. While training models, a test split is very useful as a final check on expected future performance."

You could write a for loop and iterate over each possible value, doing all the housekeeping oyurselves to track the best value of k. But this is  a common task so there's a built in function in `sklearn`. This is [`GridSearchCV`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV.html).\n",

In simple cases with no feature selection or imputation or feature scaling etc. you may see the classifier or regressor object itself directly passed into `GridSearchCV`. The other key input is the parameters and values to search over. Optional parameters include the cross-validation strategy and number of CPUs to use."

    "These results suggest that vertical drop is your biggest positive feature. This makes intuitive sense and is consistent with what you saw during the EDA work. Also, you see the area covered by snow making equipment is a strong positive as well. People like guaranteed skiing! The skiable terrain area is negatively associated with ticket price! This seems odd. People will pay less for larger resorts? There could be all manner of reasons for this. It could be  an effect whereby larger resorts can host more visitors at any one time and so can charge less per ticket. As has been mentioned previously, the data are missing information about visitor numbers. Bear in mind,  the coefficient for skiable terrain is negative _for this model_. For example, if you kept the total number of chairs and fastQuads constant, but increased the skiable terrain extent, you might imagine the resort is worse off because the chairlift capacity is stretched thinner."

    "**Q: 1** Write a summary of the work in this notebook. Capture the fact that you gained a baseline idea of performance by simply taking the average price and how well that did. Then highlight that you built a linear model and the features that found. Comment on the estimate of its performance from cross-validation and whether its performance on the test split was consistent with this estimate. Also highlight that a random forest regressor was tried, what preprocessing steps were found to be best, and again what its estimated performance via cross-validation was and whether its performance on the test set was consistent with that. State which model you have decided to use going forwards and why. This summary should provide a quick overview for someone wanting to know quickly why the given model was chosen for the next part of the business problem to help guide important business decisions."

    "\n",
    "We have split our data into two sets: a training set containing 70% of the data and a test set containing the remaining 30%. Our first 'model' consists of predicting the target values (adult weekend ticket prices) using the mean, i.e. the average adult weekend price. This results in an r^2 score of 0 when compared with the train set and slightly less than 0 when compared with test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next step is to impute any missing values. Because the distributions of many variables were skewed, the median may be a reasonable value to use (rather than the mean). We learn the median values of the features from our training set and use these medians to fill in any missing values in both the training and test sets. We then scale the data to zero mean and unit variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then train a linear regression model on our training set and then use this model to predict y values on both the training and test sets and calculate their respective r^2 scores: ~0.82 and ~0.72. The fact that r^2 is much lower for the test set suggests that we are 'overfitting'.\n",
    "\n",
    "To refine the model, we built a pipeline including scikit-learn’s ‘SelectKBest’ to limit the number of features included in the analysis. Using cross-validation (specifically, GridSearchCV) with 5 folds we find that 8 features yields the best model, with an r^2 score of just below 0.70.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we built a Random Forest Regression model to compare to our Linear Regression model. We fit and assess the model using cross-validation, tweaking a number of hyperparamater for the number of trees and feature scaling. This gives us a model with an r^2 score of just above 0.70. The top four features in both models are: vertical_drop, fastQuads, Runs, and  Snow_making_ac.\n",
    "\n",
    "The r^2 scores of our two models are close, with the RFR model explaining slightly more of the variance. Finally, we calculate their MAEs on the test sets: $11.8 for the linear model and $9.5 for the RFR model. The RFR thus outperforms the linear model in terms of both variance and mean absolute error and is therefore our choice to implement on the business problem at hand.\n",

    "- The r^2 score and MAE of the linear regression are higher when we first run it (4.8.1, MAE = ~9.4), even better than the eventual results of the RFR model. How come? And why are the scores so much lower when we build the pipeline (MAE = ~11.8)?\n",
