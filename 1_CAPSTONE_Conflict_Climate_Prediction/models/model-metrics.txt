Model:
-----------------
Lasso Regression Model


Input Features:
-----------------

death_rate: target feature
PRCP_zone_XXXX_XX:		Mean of Precipitation level measured at nearest of 25 'zone stations' for 5-year interval indicated by XXXX_XX 
TAVG_zone_XXXX_XX:  		Mean of Average Daily Temperature measured at nearest of 25 'zone stations' for 5-year interval indicated by XXXX_XX 
TMAX_zone_XXXX_XX: 		Mean of Maximum Daily Temperature measured at nearest of 25 'zone stations' for 5-year interval indicated by XXXX_XX 
TMIN_zone_XXXX_XX:  		Mean of Minimum Daily Temperature measured at nearest of 25 'zone stations' for 5-year interval indicated by XXXX_XX 
PRCP_zone_sameyear:  		Mean of Precipitation level measured at nearest of 25 'zone stations' for the year of conflict incident
TAVG_zone_sameyear:   		Mean of Average Daily Temperature measured at nearest of 25 'zone stations' for the year of conflict incident
TMAX_zone_sameyear:  		Mean of Maximum Daily Temperature measured at nearest of 25 'zone stations' for the year of conflict incident
TMIN_zone_sameyear:   		Mean of Minimum Daily Temperature measured at nearest of 25 'zone stations' for the year of conflict incident
PRCP_change_1973_2019:		Change in yearly mean Precipitation level between 1973 and 2019
TAVG_change_1973_2019:		Change in yearly mean Average Daily Temperature between 1973 and 2019
TMAX_change_1973_2019:		Change in yearly mean Maximum Daily Temperature between 1973 and 2019
TMIN_change_1973_2019:		Change in yearly mean Minimum Daily Temperature between 1973 and 2019
PRCP_change_1973_sameyear:	Change in yearly mean Precipitation level between 1973 and year of the conflict incident
TAVG_change_1973_sameyear:	Change in yearly mean Average Daily Temperature between 1973 and year of the conflict incident
TMAX_change_1973_sameyear:	Change in yearly mean Maximum Daily Temperature between 1973 and year of the conflict incident
TMIN_change_1973_sameyear:	Change in yearly mean Minimum Daily Temperature between 1973 and year of the conflict incident
 

Performance Metrics
-----------------

R2:	0.00591	
MAE:	1.99332
MSE:	16.42520

For comparison, the metrics of the baseline (Dummy Regressor) model are provided below as well:

R2:	-0.00018	
MAE:	2.00499	
MSE:	16.57384

As can be seen, for all practical purposes, the selected model performs no better than the baseline Dummy Regressor. 

 
Lasso Features Selected:
-----------------
 
PRCP_change_1973_2019    	0.251133
TAVG_change_1973_2019    	0.029950
TMIN_change_1973_2019    	0.003527

Coefficients of the remaining 29 features were set to 0 by the Lasso Regression model.
