    "\n",
    "*This section is included only as proof of progress and is not essential to the running of the project.*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lesson learned:** These functions were written before I was aware of the possibilities offered by spatial joins. By executing a spatial join of the climate stations on the buffered conflict data (done in notebook 02-rrp-data-wrangling) I was able to get all of the stations relevant to my analysis (i.e. those within 50km of any conflict) in one go. This proved more efficient than the functions I had written.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Before starting:\n",
    "From the documentation of the GHCN dataset we learn the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- There are two relevant datasets for our analysis:\n",
    " 1. The GHCN_daily dataset with daily climate measures from each station\n",
    " 2. The stations dataset with metadata (name, location, etc.) of each station\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "- Both of these datasets are stored in .dly format\n",
    "- The .dly format is a *fixed-width format* meaning that each column has a fixed width of characters. \n",
    "- As such we will need to specify the column widths and column labels in order to get this looking like something we can use.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach\n",
    "In this section, we write two functions to import the relevant GHCN data from the .tar archive:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. read_ghcn_incl_stationID: a general function that imports all .dly files from a .tar archive using the corresponding data headers and column specs.\n",
    "2. find_stations: a function that finds and extract stations with a specified radius r of a specific conflict incident."
