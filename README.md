**To what extent can we predict conflict intensity from climate data?**

![Cover Image](./9_README_files/readme_cover_image_conflict.png)

This is my first Capstone Project entitled *Heated Discussions: Predicting Conflict Intensity Using Climate Data*.

This project was completed as part of the Springboard Data Science Career Track. In this project, I investigate to what extent it is possible to predict conflict intensity based on climate data. Project design, data collection, and complete execution were done independently.

See README in the project directory for more information, incl. project outline and key findings.
